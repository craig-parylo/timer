``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("craig-parylo/timer")
```

## Features

This app is still under development and is not yet ready for regular use. Available features include:

`{timer}` helps you track work time.

Select a project and click the Start button to begin timing. Click Stop timer when you finish - the session will be saved to your activity.

![See your weekly activity in a calendar format](dev/screenshots\v0.0.0.900\calendar.png){fig-alt="A calendar view showing a week view, with time blocked out according to time recorded." width="100%"}

See recorded timers in a calendar view that shows each timed session's duration and colour-codes sessions by project.

Use the navigation buttons to browse previous weeks or jump back to today.

![See your raw data entries](dev/screenshots\v0.0.0.900\data.png){fig-alt="A table view of timer entries showing start and stop times along with ID values for the entry, the date, the week, the calendar (aka project), and the name of the project." width="100%"}

View your activity as a table of entries.

Use the sidebar control to switch the timeframe: Today, Yesterday, This week, Last week or All time.
